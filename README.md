## Very simple 30 minutes test

Using the create-react-app do the following tasks (install any library you need):

1. Do a GET request using 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' save the data.
2. Display a un-ordered list of titles from the data.
3. Create an input field for filtering by title.

Don't worry if you can't complete the task within half an hour, we just want to see your appoach and how you tackle the problem.
